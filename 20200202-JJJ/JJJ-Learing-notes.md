### Average Students vs Top Students

* Everybody keeps focusing on the tip of the mountain, but forget the climb. That's why we have average is everywhere --- average pay, house, relationships, results, everything.
* The enemy of the Best is not the Worst, it's being Average.
* Life-threatening disease --- get used to being average (like diseases not hurting very much but killing you gradually)
* Average Students: listen and follow, being asked 10, but done 8. hard to lead.
* Exceptional Students: being asked 10, think 20 (and do more). leading himself, business, and everything.



### Two Rules - Motivation and Patience

* Don't Depend on Motivation
  * If so, you're bound to fail someday sooner or later.
  * You don't always like what you do all the time, but you have to do it anyway.
  * Successful people want to be successful, they crave for their end goal.
  * Motivation is a bad dependency.
* You have to have Patience
  * Put it in work, don't expect too much in a short term, be patient.
  * 12 months passes in a blink of an eye, sooner or later it's impossible for you to not be successful.
