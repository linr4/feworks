### Top 3 mistakes you need to avoid when learning JS



1. Learning too many languages at once.

   > Just focus all your energy on JavaScript.

2. Copying code without understanding it well, and over time it causes more confusion.

   > Stop when you get stuck and figure it out at first.

3. Avoid the hard part, say avoid learning the plain JavaScript; like we know we should eat healthy and go to the gym, but not many actually do it, just because it's hard.

   > Embrace what you don't know, embrace failure, don't be afraid of failing.



So again, 

* don't learning too many languages at once, 
* don't code without understanding it, 
* don't just avoid the hard part.



And if you do that, you will have a higher chance of success.
